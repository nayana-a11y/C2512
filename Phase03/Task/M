Here's a detailed line-by-line breakdown of your code:


---

1. Importing the JSON module

import json

This imports Python's built-in json module, which is used to read and write JSON files.



---

2. Opening and Reading the JSON File

with open("usb_music.json", "r") as playbackfile:
    playback_data = json.load(playbackfile)

Opens the file "usb_music.json" in read ("r") mode.

Reads the JSON content from the file and loads it into a Python dictionary (playback_data).



---

3. Initializing Dictionaries for Categorization

successful_tracks = {"tracks": []}
failed_tracks = {"tracks": []}

Creates two dictionaries to store the results:

successful_tracks → Stores successfully played tracks.

failed_tracks → Stores tracks that failed to play.


Each dictionary has a key "tracks" with an empty list to hold track details.



---

4. Iterating Through the JSON Data

for key, value in playback_data.items():

Loops through the top-level keys and values in the playback_data dictionary.


5. Checking if the Value is a Dictionary

if isinstance(value, dict):

Ensures that value is a dictionary before processing it further.



---

6. Iterating Through the Nested Dictionary

for folder, tracks in value.items():

Loops through the sub-dictionary (which represents folders containing tracks).



---

7. Checking if Tracks are in a List

if isinstance(tracks, list):

Ensures that tracks is a list before iterating over it.



---

8. Iterating Through the List of Tracks

for track in tracks:

Loops through each track in the list.


9. Checking if Each Track is a Dictionary and is Playable

if isinstance(track, dict) and track.get("playable") == "yes":

Ensures track is a dictionary.

Checks if the track is marked as "playable": "yes" before processing it.



---

10. Extracting Relevant Track Information

track_info = {
                        "song": track.get("name"),
                        "path": track.get("containerPath"),
                        "result": "pass" if track.get("playback") == "success" else "failure"
                        }

Creates a dictionary track_info with:

"song" → Track name (track.get("name")).

"path" → Location of the track (track.get("containerPath")).

"result" → "pass" if "playback": "success", otherwise "failure".




---

11. Categorizing Tracks Based on Playback Status

if track.get("playback") == "success":
                            successful_tracks["tracks"].append(track_info)
                        elif track.get("playback") == "failure":
                            failed_tracks["tracks"].append(track_info)

If playback is "success", the track is added to successful_tracks["tracks"].

If playback is "failure", the track is added to failed_tracks["tracks"].



---

12. Writing Successful Tracks to a JSON File

with open("Successful_Tracks.json", "w") as success_file:
    json.dump(successful_tracks, success_file, indent=4)

Opens "Successful_Tracks.json" in write ("w") mode.

Writes successful_tracks dictionary to the file in formatted JSON (with indent=4 for readability).



---

13. Writing Failed Tracks to a JSON File

with open("Failed_Tracks.json", "w") as fail_file:
    json.dump(failed_tracks, fail_file, indent=4)

Opens "Failed_Tracks.json" in write ("w") mode.

Writes failed_tracks dictionary to the file in formatted JSON.



---

14. Printing Completion Message

print("Processing complete.")

Prints a message indicating that processing is done.



---

Summary

This script:

1. Reads usb_music.json.


2. Extracts tracks marked as "playable": "yes".


3. Checks if playback was "success" or "failure".


4. Categorizes them into two dictionaries (successful_tracks and failed_tracks).


5. Saves the results to two JSON files.


6. Prints "Processing complete." at the end.
