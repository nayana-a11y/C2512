Benefits of web applications
    1. After application development 
        we can deploy into production site server
        or 
        we can deploy into servers 
            like  
                dedicated server (purchased - on-site-premise)
                OR 
                shared server (virtual server) (purchased)
                OR 
                cloud like 
                    Google Cloud 
                    Azure Cloud 
                    Amazon Clound
