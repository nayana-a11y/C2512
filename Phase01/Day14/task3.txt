Linux Architecture 

Linux is an open-source operating system like Windows and MacOS. It is not just limited to the operating system, but nowadays,
 it is also used as a platform to run desktops, servers, and embedded systems. 

1. `Hardware Layer`:  
   - Physical components like CPU, memory, and storage.  
   - Linux interacts with this layer via drivers.

2. `Kernel Layer`:  
   - Core of the operating system.  
   - Manages hardware resources, memory, processes, and devices.  
   - Types of kernels:
         Monolithic, Microkernal, Hybrid kernal, Nano Kernal, Exo Kernal.
     - `Monolithic Kernel` (used by Linux): All functions run in one layer.
   
3. `System Call Interface (Shell)`:  
   - Acts as a bridge between applications and the kernel.  
   - Allows programs to request kernel services.

4. `System Libraries`:  
   - Pre-written code that helps applications use OS features.  
     static and dynamic.
   - Example: GNU C Library (glibc) for file management and networking.

5. `User Space (Applications)`:  
   - Programs and utilities run in this layer.  
   - Examples: Text editors, browsers, terminal.

6. `Shell`:  
   - Command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the kernel.  
   - Types: Bash, Zsh, etc.

This layered design ensures stability, flexibility, and security.

Linux Shell

1. `What is a Shell?`  
   - A command-line interface (CLI) 
   that allows users to interact 
   with the Linux operating system.

2. `Types of Shells`:  
   - `Bash (Bourne Again Shell)`: Most common and beginner-friendly.  
         widely available and installed by default on most linus and macOS.

   - `Zsh (Z Shell)`: Advanced features and customizations.  
         powerful and versatile shell with features such as auto-completion , spelling correction, and history manipulation.

   - `Ksh (Korn Shell)`: For scripting and programming.  
         combines features from the Bourne shell and the C shell, and includes command substitution, integer arithmetic features.
         an improved version of Bourne shell. It also provides advanced features.
   - `Tcsh/Csh (C Shell)`: Syntax similar to C programming.  
         improved readability and performance.

3. `Functions of the Shell`:  
     
   - Execute commands.  
   - Run shell scripts (automating tasks).  
   - Provide an interface between the user and kernel.

4. `Features`:  
   - Command history.  
   - Tab completion.  
   - Redirection and piping.  
   - Job control (background/foreground processes).  

5. `Examples of Use`:  
   - Navigating files (`cd`, `ls`).  
   - Managing processes (`ps`, `kill`).  
   - File operations (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`).  

Linux shells are powerful tools 
for interacting with the system efficiently!
